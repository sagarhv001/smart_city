During my internship, I was involved in several key activities that provided a comprehensive understanding of the industrial application of machine learning and data science.

#Week 1:

Introduction to the project and understanding the problem statement.
Gathering and exploring the dataset.
Cleaning and preprocessing the data to prepare it for analysis.

#Week 2:

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in the traffic data.
Visualizing the data using various plotting techniques.
Understanding the relationships between different variables.

#Week 3:

Implementing basic machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
Evaluating the performance of these models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Understanding the limitations of basic models in capturing complex patterns.

#Week 4:

Building and training advanced machine learning models, including LSTM and Sequential models.
Tuning the hyperparameters of these models to improve their performance.
Assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting traffic patterns.

#Week 5:

Developing a dynamic traffic management system to address peak traffic hours based on model predictions.
Integrating the trained models into the system for real-time traffic prediction.
Evaluating the performance of the system under different traffic conditions.

#Week 6:

Training and evaluating additional machine learning models (RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, SupportVectorRegressor, XGBoostRegressor).
Comparing the performance of these models to identify the best one for traffic prediction.
Finalizing the project report and preparing for the final presentation.
